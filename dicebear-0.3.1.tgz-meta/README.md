# dicebear chart

This chart deploys a self-hosted [DiceBear](https://www.dicebear.com/) avatar HTTP API
(the upstream `dicebear/api` image, mirrored to `gsoci.azurecr.io/giantswarm/dicebear-api`).

**What is this app?**

DiceBear is an open-source avatar generator. This chart runs its HTTP API in-cluster so
the platform can render agent avatar icons — two initials on a deterministic, color-blind-safe
colored background, derived entirely from an agent's technical name.

**Why did we add it?**

Agents on the platform need a stable visual identity that looks the same across every
surface (Backstage, Slack, and any future chat surface). Self-hosting removes a
third-party runtime dependency and rate limits from a customer-facing feature, and lets us
raise the raster output-size cap. See [giantswarm/giantswarm#37211](https://github.com/giantswarm/giantswarm/issues/37211).

**Who can use it?**

The agent platform (bumblebee) deploys it wherever the platform bundle runs. It is not
intended for direct customer configuration.

## Installing

## Compatibility

This app has been tested to work with the following workload cluster release versions:

- _add release version_

## Limitations

Some apps have restrictions on how they can be deployed.
Not following these limitations will most likely result in a broken deployment.

- _add limitation_
