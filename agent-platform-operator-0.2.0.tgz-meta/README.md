# agent-platform-operator

Operator of the Agent Platform's organizations: reconciles each AgentPlatformOrganization (agent-platform.giantswarm.io) into its organization namespace, curated copies and organization cleanup

## The AgentPlatformOrganization

An `AgentPlatformOrganization` (`agent-platform.giantswarm.io/v1alpha1`, namespaced) is a share of the installation's Agent Platform for one team. It lives in a **parent namespace**: on a Giant Swarm installation the Giant Swarm Organization's `org-<name>`. Its agents, MCP servers, models, credentials and members live in its **organization namespace**, which the operator creates.

```yaml
apiVersion: agent-platform.giantswarm.io/v1alpha1
kind: AgentPlatformOrganization
metadata:
  name: payments
  namespace: org-acme
  annotations:
    agent-platform.giantswarm.io/display-name: Payments
spec:
  harnesses: [kagent]
  workers:
    replicas: 1
```

- `spec.harnesses`: the curated Harnesses the organization gets.
- `spec.workers.replicas`: the warm workers of the organization's WorkerPool, while it can use them (see "Curated copies").
- The annotation `agent-platform.giantswarm.io/display-name` holds the name people see. It is not a spec field.
- The name is at most 50 characters and holds no dot, because the organization namespace name `agents-<name>-…` must be a DNS label. The CRD refuses other names.

The status holds:

- `namespace`: the organization namespace.
- `snapshotPrefix`: `s3://<bucket>/<uid>`, where the organization's worker snapshots live. It is empty when the operator has no bucket (`snapshots.bucket`).
- `conditions`, each with `observedGeneration`. `Ready` is `True` when the namespace exists and holds every object below. It is `False` with reason `SourceMissing` while a network policy to copy is missing from `platformNamespace`, `NamespaceTerminating` while the organization namespace is terminating, `NameTaken` while an object the operator did not write holds the name of a RoleBinding, a curated copy or the ResourceQuota it keeps (a mirror keeps the parent binding's name), and `ReconcileFailed` when a write fails. `SourceMissing` also covers a curated object to copy.
  - `DefaultModelConfigured` (set with `curated.enabled`) is `True` while exactly one ModelConfig in the organization namespace carries the annotation `agent-platform.giantswarm.io/is-default-model-config: "true"` (giantswarm-platform-manager#789). It is `False` with reason `NoDefaultModelConfig` when none does and `SeveralDefaultModelConfigs` when more than one does: the curated Agents then have no model.
  - `Orphaned` (set with `commitMode.installationKustomization.name`) is `True` while the organization carries the ownership labels of the installation's Kustomization (`kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/name` and `/namespace`) but is missing from that Kustomization's `status.inventory`: its file is gone from git. The reason is `DeleteMerged` when the organization carries `agent-platform.giantswarm.io/delete-pull-request` (agent-manager's delete pull request merged), and `MissingFromGit` otherwise (a git mistake). It is `False` with reason `InInventory` while the organization is in the inventory, and absent on an organization without those labels (applied without git). While the operator cannot read the inventory, and while that Kustomization is not settled (not `Ready` for its current generation, or `Reconciling`: Flux labels an object before it records it in the inventory), the condition stays as it was. The operator is not ready (its readiness probe fails, naming the flag) while `--installation-kustomization` names a Kustomization that does not exist, and becomes ready once Flux creates it. A Kustomization or Flux ServiceAccount named after the organization namespace that lost the organization's UID label is not taken over (`NameTaken`), and cleanup stops at it in its Workloads step, before the namespace goes, naming it and both labels to restore (`organization-uid` and `organization-object: flux`), until they are back or someone deletes it. The worker replica rule reads it.

## The organization namespace

The operator creates the namespace with `generateName: agents-<name>-`, so the API server adds 5 random characters (`agents-payments-x7k2q`). The namespace carries these labels:

| Label | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `agent-platform.giantswarm.io/organization` | the AgentPlatformOrganization's name |
| `agent-platform.giantswarm.io/parent` | the parent namespace |
| `agent-platform.giantswarm.io/organization-uid` | the AgentPlatformOrganization's UID |

The operator finds the namespace by the `organization-uid` label, never by its name. When the status is lost, or a create stopped before the status was written, the next reconcile finds the same namespace and creates no second one. The namespace has no ownerReference to the AgentPlatformOrganization.

In the namespace the operator keeps, from the first reconcile on:

- the network policies `networkPolicy.names`, copied from `platformNamespace`;
- the agent chart's OCIRepository (`agentChart.*`), named after the chart (`agent`);
- the Helm ServiceAccount `helmReleaseServiceAccount`, which the organization's HelmReleases run as, with a RoleBinding to the ClusterRole `agent-platform-tenant-flux`;
- a mirror of each admin binding in the parent namespace: the same name, the roleRef `agent-platform:organizations-admin`, and the `User` and `Group` subjects only. The operator skips ServiceAccount subjects and subjects whose name starts with `system:`. A subject that leaves the parent binding leaves the mirror, and the mirror goes when the parent binding goes or its deletion starts (a finalizer may hold it). These parent bindings are mirrored:
  - every RoleBinding to the ClusterRole `agent-platform:organizations-admin`;
  - every RoleBinding to the ClusterRole `cluster-admin` labelled `giantswarm.io/managed-by: rbac-operator`. In a Giant Swarm Organization's namespace `org-<name>`, rbac-operator writes `write-all-customer-group` (the installation's customer admin groups), `write-all-customer-sa` (the automation ServiceAccount) and `flux-namespace-reconciler` (Flux's controllers), and a copy of each RoleBindingTemplate that selects the organization (a per-organization admin binding written as a RoleBindingTemplate to `cluster-admin` is mirrored). `write-all-customer-sa` and `flux-namespace-reconciler` have ServiceAccount subjects only, so they yield no mirror.

  These parent bindings are not mirrored: a `cluster-admin` RoleBinding without that label (one written by hand in the parent namespace), and a binding to any other role. The operator never binds `cluster-admin` in the organization namespace.

  The rule is the Go package `github.com/giantswarm/agent-platform-operator/pkg/adminmirror` (`IsMirroredAdmin`, `Mirrors`, `MirroredSubjects`, and the table `Cases`). `IsMirroredAdmin` selects the parent bindings the operator watches, a binding being deleted included, so its delete event removes the mirror; `Mirrors` is whether a binding counts now: the operator writes no mirror of a binding with a deletion timestamp. It is the contract this operator and agent-manager follow: agent-manager's `create_organization` pre-write check (giantswarm/agent-manager#335) predicts the organization's first admins with these functions only, and both repositories' tests run `Cases`. The package imports only the Kubernetes API types.

- the ResourceQuota `agent-platform-organization-objects` on object counts (`objectQuota`), so one organization cannot flood the API server with objects;
- in commit mode, the RoleBinding `organization-flux` that binds the organization's Flux ServiceAccount to `commitMode.clusterRole` (`agent-platform:organization-flux`).

## Commit mode

With `commitMode.sourceRef.name` (it needs `erasure.fluxNamespace`), an organization's contents (agents, models, connectors, egress, members) come from git. The operator keeps, for each organization, beside the installation's Flux source in `erasure.fluxNamespace`:

- a ServiceAccount, the organization's Flux ServiceAccount, bound only in the organization namespace, by the RoleBinding `organization-flux`;
- a Kustomization that applies the organization's path (`commitMode.path`, `{parent}` and `{name}` replaced) from the source `commitMode.sourceRef`, decrypted with the SOPS key `commitMode.decryptionSecret`, into the organization namespace (`targetNamespace`) as that ServiceAccount (`serviceAccountName`, which Flux impersonates). A merged file that writes outside the organization namespace is refused. The Kustomization prunes (`prune: true`), waits on deletion until what it applied is gone (`deletionPolicy: WaitForTermination`) and is never suspended (`suspend: false`). An edit of it is reverted.

Both are named after the organization namespace (`agents-payments-x7k2q`), so every organization Kustomization starts with `agents-`. Both carry `agent-platform.giantswarm.io/organization-uid: <uid>` and `agent-platform.giantswarm.io/organization-object: flux`. The operator deletes the Kustomization first and the ServiceAccount last. Keep `commitMode.path` outside what the installation's Kustomization applies, or the installation's identity applies the organization's files too. In a parent namespace, an `agent-platform:organizations-admin` RoleBinding named `organization-flux` is not mirrored in commit mode (the organization is `Ready=False NameTaken` until it is renamed): the name is the organization's Flux binding. No controller-wide Flux multi-tenancy flag is needed.

Every organization's Kustomization decrypts with the installation's SOPS key, as every other manager writing to the installation's repository does. A file merged into an organization's path can therefore carry ciphertext copied from elsewhere in the repository, which Flux decrypts into the organization namespace. A `kustomization.yaml` in an organization's path can also list a file of another path (`../`), which the same key decrypts. A Flux source or a SOPS key per organization, which closes this, is tracked in giantswarm/agent-platform-operator#15. Until then the control is platform review of every merge into an organization's path, through CODEOWNERS of the installation repository that an organization's admin cannot change, never that organization's admin alone: agent-manager#292 (slice 11, the repository layout) owns it. A CI check in the installation repositories that refuses `..` in an organization's `kustomization.yaml` is giantswarm/giantswarm#39013. The agent-platform chart's ClusterRole `agent-platform:organization-flux` says the same.

## Curated copies

With `curated.enabled` (it needs `snapshots.bucket`), the operator also keeps read-only copies of the curated objects of `platformNamespace` in every organization namespace:

- the Harnesses `spec.harnesses` names, with `substrate.workerPoolRef` set to the organization's pool, `substrate.snapshotPolicy.location` set to `s3://<bucket>/<uid>/<harness>` `kagent.memory` removed, and no compaction summarizer model (compaction uses the agent's own model);
- the WorkerPool `curated.workerPool` with the ServiceAccount its workers run as, and the placement labels `kagent.dev/worker-pool-name` and `kagent.dev/worker-pool-namespace`;
- the Agents and AgentTemplates labelled `agent-platform.giantswarm.io/curated: "true"` (and an AgentTemplate a curated Agent's `templateRef` names), with the template's `modelConfig` set to the organization's default ModelConfig, or removed while there is none;
- the RemoteMCPServers the tools of those templates name: the muster server the curated Agents reach their tools through.

A copy carries its source's `kagent.dev/` labels (`kagent.dev/discovery: disabled` on the muster server), and no other label of the source.

**The worker replica rule**: the WorkerPool copy runs `spec.workers.replicas`, except 0 replicas while the organization namespace holds no ModelConfig (of any name) and while the organization is `Orphaned`. A deleted organization runs `spec.workers.replicas` until its sessions are gone, whatever else holds, since kagent needs a worker to suspend an actor, and 0 after (see "Organization cleanup").

A copy follows its source: a change in `platformNamespace`, a move of the default mark, or a change of `spec.harnesses` re-copies it into every organization it concerns. A copy whose source is no longer curated for the organization goes. An edit of a copy is reverted. The copies carry `agent-platform.giantswarm.io/organization-object: curated`, which the admission policy that refuses edits to them selects, and `agent-platform.giantswarm.io/copied-from: <platformNamespace>/<name>`.

The operator labels what it writes with `agent-platform.giantswarm.io/organization-object` and `app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: agent-platform-operator`. It never changes or deletes an object without that label, except what cleanup deletes in a deleted organization's namespace.

## Organization cleanup

Organization deletion requests removal; organization cleanup removes the resources it leaves behind. See the [glossary](GLOSSARY.md) for the lifecycle terms. Cleanup does not promise a secure wipe of storage media or removal of retained session metadata.

Every AgentPlatformOrganization carries the finalizer `agent-platform.giantswarm.io/erasure`. When it is deleted, by itself or with its parent namespace, the operator cleans up in this order, and removes the finalizer only after the last step:

1. **Workloads**: it deletes the organization's Flux Kustomization and waits until it is gone, then deletes the HelmReleases left in the organization namespace (all of them where there is no Kustomization) and its Agents (the curated copies, and Agents written outside git), and waits until they are gone.
2. **Sessions**: it lists every creator's sessions of the organization namespace's Agents, Agents already gone included, through the kagent controller (`erasure.kagent.target`), on `kagent.api.v1alpha1` asking for that namespace only (on `kagent.api.v1`, or on a kagent without the namespace filter, every namespace's sessions are listed and the operator keeps the organization's), and deletes each, until none is left, then waits until Substrate's ate-api (`erasure.substrate.target`) holds no actor in the organization's atespace (the namespace's name).
3. **Snapshots**: it deletes every object under `status.snapshotPrefix`, and again after `erasure.snapshotDelay` (default 5m, Substrate's default actor workflow deadline), for an upload that started before the last actor went.
4. **Namespace**: it deletes the organization namespace and waits until it is gone.
5. **OutsideObjects**: it deletes the organization's Flux ServiceAccount beside the installation's Flux source, and waits until it is gone.
6. It removes the finalizer.

While cleanup runs, `Ready` is `False` with reason `Deleting`; `status.erasureStep` and the condition's message name the step, and the message names a failure. A failing step is retried with backoff; a step that waits looks again every `erasure.pollInterval`. An organization created again with the same parent and name gets a new UID, so a new namespace and snapshot prefix.

The operator finds the organization's Flux Kustomization and Flux ServiceAccount in the namespace of the installation's Flux source (`erasure.fluxNamespace`, the agent-platform chart's `agentPlatformOrganizations.fluxNamespace`) by the label `agent-platform.giantswarm.io/organization-uid: <uid>`, the label the agent-platform chart's admission policy holds the operator's writes there to. It looks nowhere else: the label in another namespace names nothing the operator created. Without `erasure.fluxNamespace` there are none.

The operator keeps its progress in `status.erasureStep` and `status.snapshotsErasedAt`: install the chart so that its CRD is upgraded with it (Flux `upgrade.crds: CreateReplace`), or the API server drops those fields.

kagent must authorize cross-creator session deletion for a caller granted `delete` on `sessions.api.kagent.dev` cluster-wide ([giantswarm/kagent-extensions#27](https://github.com/giantswarm/kagent-extensions/issues/27)). Without it, cleanup stops at the Sessions step and reports kagent's error in the condition.

Existing interface names retain `erasure` for compatibility: Helm values under `erasure`, the finalizer, status fields and the `--snapshot-erase-delay` and `--erasure-poll-interval` flags configure or report organization cleanup.

The operator calls kagent's SessionService, `kagent.api.v1` or `kagent.api.v1alpha1` whichever the controller serves, and Substrate as its own ServiceAccount, with a projected token of each server's audience (`erasure.kagent.audience`, `erasure.substrate.audience`): kagent must admit it as a machine caller with cluster-wide `list` and `delete` on `sessions.api.kagent.dev`, and ate-api must trust the token. It verifies ate-api's serving certificate with `erasure.substrate.caClusterTrustBundle` (the ClusterTrustBundles of a signer, projected into the pod) or `erasure.substrate.caConfigMap`, reading the bundle at each new connection, so a rotated CA is trusted without a restart. It deletes snapshots with the AWS SDK's default credentials: on a management cluster, the IRSA role in `serviceAccount.annotations`. The agent-platform chart renders that role and the kagent grant.
